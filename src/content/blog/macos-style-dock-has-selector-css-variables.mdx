Ever since the :has selector was introduced to CSS and got [decent support](https://caniuse.com/css-has), I wanted to use it in a project. I finally found a use case for it, and I'm going to show you how I used it to create a macOS style dock.

## Setting up the dock

The dock is a simple unordered list with a few list items. Each list item has an icon and a label. The icon is an SVG, and the label is a text. The unordered list is wrapped in a `<footer>` tag, which has `position: fixed` applied to it to keep it at the bottom of the screen.
To align the footer horizontally, I used `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`.

```astro
---
import FooterLink from "./FooterLink.astro";
---

<footer
  class="fixed bottom-4 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 z-30 max-w-[92%] pt-14 px-4"
>
  <nav
    class="bg-primary rounded-2xl flex items-center px-3 lg:px-4 py-4 lg:py-6"
  >
    <ul class="flex">
      <FooterLink label="Home" href="/" />
      <FooterLink label="Personal" href="/personal" />
      <FooterLink label="Portfolio" href="/portfolio" />
      <FooterLink label="Blog" href="/blog" />
      <FooterLink label="Contact" href="/contact" />
      <hr class="bg-secondary h-[1.82rem] w-[2px] mx-2" />
      <FooterLink
        label="LinkedIn"
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasledoux91"
      />
      <FooterLink label="GitHub" href="https://github.com/thomasledoux1" />
    </ul>
  </nav>
</footer>
```
