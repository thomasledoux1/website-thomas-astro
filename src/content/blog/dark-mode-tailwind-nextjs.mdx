Yesterday I was working on my personal website, and I really wanted to add a dark
mode toggle. I already converted my site to use Tailwind before, so how do I enable
dark mode now?

It's simple: in Tailwind v2 dark mode is built in (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

To be able to toggle the dark mode, you should put `darkMode: 'class'` in your `tailwind.config.js`.
This configuration implies that a class called `dark` will be added to the `<html>` tag.
Once this class is active, your `dark:{class}` classes will become active.

To link this functionality up with Next.js I used the lightweight <b>next-themes</b> library (https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

After installing this library, simply change your \_app.js to include the ThemeProvider:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

<b>
  Including the `attribute="class"` is very important, since this tells the
  library to use the Tailwind dark theme class.
</b>

For the toggle button I used the following:

```jsx
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";

const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

return (
  <button
    aria-label="Toggle Dark Mode"
    type="button"
    className="p-3 h-12 w-12 order-2 md:order-3"
    onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")}
  />
);
```

An example of the `dark:{class}` code, this will use a purple background color for light mode and a darkgrey color for dark mode:

```jsx
return <nav className="fixed bg-purple dark:bg-darkgrey h-16 w-full z-50" />;
```

And that's it! The theme is being switched when you click the button.
