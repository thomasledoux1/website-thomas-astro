I was looking for a use case to start using Actions and Server Islands, two new utilities that were added to Astro (experimentally) in version 4.
Luckily, I always have my personal blog as a playground to test new features.

## What are Actions and Server Islands?

### Server Islands

Server Islands make it possible to defer a component so it renders asynchronolously after the page has rendered.
This is particulary useful when you want to render a page statically to an HTML file containing a placeholder.
This placeholder will then be replaced by the **dynamic** content coming in from your server.

This allows for the HTML to be cached by a CDN, improving overall performance.
By using Server Islands you can run code in a secure environment on your server where you can connect to all sorts of things: databases, API's..

### Actions

Actions make it possible to call a function on your backend, without needing to create an API route for this.
An extra benefit is that you benefit from full type-safety, so you know which parameters are expected, and what will be returned.
More things are included:

- Automatically validate JSON and form data inputs using Zod validation.
- Generate type-safe functions to call your backend from the client and even from HTML form actions. No need for manual fetch() calls.
- Standardize backend errors with the ActionError object.

## Using the Action on every page view

### Creating the action

Let's define the action in code, under `/actions/index.ts`.

```ts title="src/actions/index.ts"
import { ActionError, defineAction } from "astro:actions";
import { z } from "astro:schema";
import { PageView, db } from "astro:db";
import { isbot } from "isbot";

export const server = {
  pageView: defineAction({
    input: z.object({
      url: z.string(),
    }),
    handler: async ({ url }, context) => {
      const { request } = context;

      if (isbot(request.headers.get("user-agent"))) {
        throw new ActionError({
          code: "FORBIDDEN",
          message: "This endpoint is not available for bots",
        });
      }
      if (url === "/page-views") {
        throw new ActionError({
          code: "BAD_REQUEST",
          message: "This url is not tracked",
        });
      }
      try {
        await db.insert(PageView).values({
          url: url,
          date: new Date(),
        });
        return {};
      } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        throw new ActionError({
          code: "BAD_REQUEST",
          message: "Error updating views",
        });
      }
    },
  }),
};
```

The input gets validated through the Zod schema, and in the handler we use the `isbot` package to verify the request is not coming from a bot, since we don't want to track those in the page views.

I also want to ignore the `/page-views` url, since this is the URL for my dashboard where I visualize the page views.
Once all these checks passed, we can insert the page view into the database ([read about my move to Astro DB here](/blog/astro-db-migrating-analytics-postgres)).

If an error would occur during this insertion, we'll also throw an `AstroError`.

### Calling the action

I call the action in my shared layout through a `<script>` tag.

```html
<script>
  import { actions } from "astro:actions";
  actions.pageView({ url: window.location.pathname });
</script>
```

Since I'm not using the `View Transitions` [router](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#script-behavior-with-view-transitions), this script will get executed on every page, since it's running in a normal MPA mode.

## Using Server Islands to show the view count on blog posts

I used to have quite some React code in place to show the view count on my blog, where I'd first render a placeholder.
With `@tanstack/react-query` I'd fetch the view count from the database through an `API route`, and then render this instead of the placeholder.
This of course added some extra complexity and setup, and I didn't have type-safety on the API route.

Now I was able to replace all this React code with a few lines of Astro code:

```astro title="src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro"
View count:
<ViewCount server:defer url={`/blog/${frontmatter.id}`}
  ><div slot="fallback">
    <span class="animate-loading h-[19.5px] inline-block w-12 rounded-sm"
    ></span>
  </div></ViewCount
>
```

By adding the `server:defer` directive, I tell Astro to create a Server Island for this component.
It will use the fallback content for the initial render, and then render the `<ViewCount>` when it's doing fetching the data inside of the component.
The component's code:

```astro title="src/components/ViewCount.astro"
---
import { PageView, count, db, eq } from "astro:db";
const { url } = Astro.props;

const viewCount = await db
  .select({ value: count() })
  .from(PageView)
  .where(eq(PageView.url, url));
---

<span class="font-bold">{viewCount[0]?.value}</span>
```

This enables me to write very little code, with type-safety and the ability to run server-side code in my component, without having to opt in to `on-demand server rendering` on the full page.

I hope you liked the explanation, let me know in the comments below if you have any questions or remarks!

The code is running live on [my blog](/blog), and the code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasledoux1/website-thomas-astro).
