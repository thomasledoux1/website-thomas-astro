## Why Algolia?

At my job we use Algolia all the time, it's got good out of the box React components and hooks which make it super easy to create search experiences.
They have a generous [free tier](https://www.algolia.com/pricing) with 10k search requests per month and up to 1M records.
In one of my [previous blog posts](https://www.thomasledoux.be/blog/search-static-astro-website) I wrote about using the `astro-pagefind` integration to index my website fully static (the index is stored in your build output).
I was curious as to how it worked to plug pagefind into the Astro build process, so I dug into the source code.

## How I implemented it

Setting up the [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) was very easy: create a TypeScript file (calling mine `algolia-integration.ts`) and export a function adhering to the `AstroIntegration` type.
You'll give the integration a name, and you specify which integration hooks you want to use.
In this case we only need the `astro:build:done` hook, since we want to process the HTML after the build was done by Astro.

Loading environment variables inside the integration is done through the `loadEnv()` function from Vite.
Once we have the environment variables available, we instantiate the `algoliasearch` client with the App ID and API key from Algolia (can be found on your Algolia dashboard).

Then we read all the HTML files from the build output folder using `glob`, and I added 2 files to `ignore`, since I don't want them to be indexed.
With this glob result we can start looping over the HTML files, parse them and send them to Algolia.

For the parsing part I used `cheerio`, which provides a jQuery-like API to do different operations on the HTML.
In the integration I used it to read the HTML and to remove some HTML tags and all the content in between the tags to limit the size of my output.

To trim down the size of the records even further I decided to use the `stopword` package, which uses a dictionary of common stop words, and contains a function `removeStopwords()` to remove them from your content.

With my content prepared for indexing, I can then index the records to Algolia using the `partialUpdateObject()` function, allowing me to update the records if they exist, or creating a new record if there's none in Algolia yet.

```ts
import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro";
import { algoliasearch } from "algoliasearch";
import { loadEnv } from "vite";
import { glob } from "glob";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import fs from "fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";
import * as cheerio from "cheerio";
import stopword from "stopword";

export default function pagefind(): AstroIntegration {
  return {
    name: "algolia",
    hooks: {
      "astro:build:done": async ({ logger, dir }) => {
        const {
          PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID,
          ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY,
          PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME,
        } = loadEnv(process.env.NODE_ENV ?? "", process.cwd(), "");
        const search = algoliasearch(
          PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID ?? "",
          ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY ?? "",
        );
        const pathToRead = fileURLToPath(dir);
        const globResult = await glob("**/*.html", {
          cwd: pathToRead,
          ignore: ["page-views/**", "search/**"],
        });

        for (const file of globResult) {
          const filePath = path.join(pathToRead, file);
          const fileContent = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf-8");

          // Parse HTML
          const $ = cheerio.load(fileContent);
          const title = $("h1").text().replace(/\s+/g, " ").trim();

          // Remove <script>, <footer> and <style> content
          $("script, style, footer, pre, [data-pagefind-ignore]").remove();

          // Extract text and clean up whitespace
          let text = $("body").text();
          // Normalize whitespace: replace multiple spaces, newlines, and tabs with a single space
          text = text.replace(/\s+/g, " ").trim();
          let words = text.split(/\s+/);

          // Remove stopwords to avoid hitting record size limits
          words = stopword.removeStopwords(words);

          // Convert back to a string
          const content = words.join(" ");

          try {
            await search.partialUpdateObject({
              createIfNotExists: true,
              objectID:
                file === "index.html"
                  ? "home"
                  : file.replace("/index.html", ""),
              attributesToUpdate: {
                content,
                title: file === "index.html" ? "Homepage" : title,
              },
              indexName: PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME ?? "",
            });
          } catch (e) {
            logger.error("Error updating Algolia index for file: " + file);
          }
        }
      },
    },
  };
}
```

## Activating the integration

Once the integration is finished, activating it is as easy as importing the integration we created and adding it to the `integrations` array in the `astro.config.ts` file.
Since I use astro with almost exclusively static pages, every page will have an HTML output (even my blog articles written in MDX), so I can index everything.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

import algolia from "./algolia-integration";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [algolia()],
});
```

## Quering Algolia

Since I'm used to using Algolia combined with React at my job, I decided to also use it that way on my website.
Just know that you could just write an API route or Astro Action which queries Algolia serverside, or using the JS SDK client side, or using the [Vue components](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/vue/) from Algolia.. There's plenty of ways to consume the data, in the end it's just an API being exposed.
So I created my `pages/search.astro` which just loads my [Client Island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#client-islands).

```astro
---
import Layout from "~/layouts/Layout.astro";
import SearchComponent from "../components/Search.tsx";
---

<Layout title="Search">
  <SearchComponent client:load />
</Layout>
```

In my SearchComponent I import the CSS from Algolia since I'm too lazy to write my own CSS ðŸ˜….
You can see I use the `algoliasearch/lite` package, which is a lighter version of the package with the limitation that you can not use the package to index records.
I use the out of the box components from `react-instantsearch` (the React component library from Algolia) to have a search box available, the hits displayed for my search query and the `Snippet` which provides a handy snippet with highlighting of the search result.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import "instantsearch.css/themes/satellite.css";

import { liteClient as algoliasearch, type Hit } from "algoliasearch/lite";
import { InstantSearch, SearchBox, Hits, Snippet } from "react-instantsearch";

const searchClient = algoliasearch(
  import.meta.env.PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID,
  import.meta.env.PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY,
);

function Hit({ hit }: { hit: Hit }) {
  return (
    <a href={`/${hit.objectID}`} className="hit">
      <h3>{hit.title as string}</h3>
      {/* @ts-expect-error Algolia types seem incorrect */}
      <Snippet attribute="content" hit={hit} />
    </a>
  );
}

export default function AlgoliaSearch() {
  return (
    <InstantSearch
      searchClient={searchClient}
      indexName={import.meta.env.PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}
    >
      <SearchBox placeholder="Search through my site" />
      <Hits hitComponent={Hit} />
    </InstantSearch>
  );
}
```

The end result looks like this:

  src={screenshot}
  alt="Search results being shown for the query `React`"

## Conclusion

The integration was very easy to set up, certainly with great examples being available on the [integrations overview](https://astro.build/integrations/) and good documentation as usual.
The only thing I bumped into was the [size limit](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406981897617-Is-there-a-size-limit-for-my-index-records) of the records, which is limited to 10KB for the free plan, which was not enough for my initial attempts without trimming, removing stopwords and unneeded HTML.
But in the end using the tricks shown above I was able to stay under the limit, and have my whole website indexed in Algolia! Yay!

Do note that this indexing technique is quite naive, you would need some more scrubbing of the HTML to make sure you don't index any information you wouldn't want to, and you'd probably want to do some additional checks in the integration to make sure you only send the data to Algolia on your production builds, not on preview builds etc.
