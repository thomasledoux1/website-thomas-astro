            Hi, I&apos;m Thomas. I&apos;m {age} years old, living in Ghent.
            <br />
            I&apos;m a professional <b>Frontend Developer</b>, currently working
            at The Reference and 1 day a week as a self employed developer. I'm
            always looking for new opportunities to work on for my side
            activity, so feel free to <a class="underline" href="/contact"
              >contact me</a
            >!
          </p>

              In general I really love to travel. My favourite kind of holiday
              is a roadtrip with a campervan, doing lots of hikes in nature and
              going for a swim in the sea at the end of the day!
              <br />
              When I&apos;m not traveling I like to sport a lot. I play badminton,
              cycle a lot, and I go for the occasional run.
            </p>
            <p>
              I studied Applied Computer Sciences at Hogeschool Gent. I chose
              the Mobile Development track, and went on Erasmus to Barcelona to
              learn more about Swift and Java. <br />
              After graduating I worked for the startup Happs as a full-stack developer,
              where I created and maintained the website. <br />I also created
              an app for a client in React Native during this period.
